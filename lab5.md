*Welcome to my Lab Report 5!*

Part 1 of this lab report is written in the style of a conversation on EdStem. It explores how a debugging scenario may unravel between a student asking for help and their tutor/TA.

Part 2 of this lab report is a reflection on my learning experience in CSE15L. It lists a few of the interesting things I learnt over the second half of the quarter.

**TA/Tutor Response**

*Your code for reverseInPlace seems correct. Perhaps the error lies in your tests and not in your method? Please verify the expected and actual values from your tests*

**Student Response**

*After reviewing my tests again, I realized that I had inserted the incorrect expected value for my first test. I have now fixed that error. Thanks for the help. *
