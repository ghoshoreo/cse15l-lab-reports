CSE 15L Lab Report 1
====================
**Welcome to Lab Report 1!** *This blog contains a tutorial for incoming CSE15L students.*


Overview: This lab report details the steps I took to during my own lab session. These steps include setting up your system, logging into remote access, and understanding the various commands one can try on the terminal.

1. Installing VSCode
2. Remotely connecting
3. Trying some commands


Step 1: Installing Visual Studio Code (VSCode)
------------------------------------

For my CSE11: "Intro to Programming" class, I had installed VSCode to run my code. Consequently, I already had VSCode installed in my sytem upon entering this class. 
However, here's a link to get you started: [Link](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

After you have completed the required steps, you should have something that looks like this.

Step 2: Remote Connecting
-------------------------

We will now proceed to the next step of this tutorial. Our next step is to install **git**. To install **git** for my system (Windows), I used the this link: [Link](https://gitforwindows.org/). Once **git** is downloaded, you need to set up the terminal in VSCode to use **git bash**. For Windows, this link should help: [Link](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/42606837/how-do-i-use-bash-on-windows-from-the-visual-studio-code-integrated-terminal/50527994#50527994)

This brings us to end of our system setup! Now, we can use the **ssh** command to connect our system to the remote server. (*At this point, you should look up you sourse specific account. Follow this link to access it:* [Link](https://sdacs.ucsd.edu/~icc/index.php))

Now, open a terminal in VScode. Your command will look like this, but with the zz replaced by the letters in your course-specific account.

```
$ ssh cs15lsp23zz@ieng6.ucsd.edu
```

Congratulations! Your terminal is connected to a computer in the CSE Basement. For reference, here is what a screenshot of my connection looked like (*keep in mind I had a few failed login attempts*)

Step 3: Trying some commands
----------------------------

Let us try some commands! 

As a refresher, **ls** is a command used to list the files and directories.

Here are a few of the commands I tried during my lab session. Feel free to try any of them!
