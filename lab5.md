*Welcome to my Lab Report 5!*

Part 1 of this lab report is written in the style of a conversation on EdStem. It explores how a debugging scenario may unravel between a student asking for help and their tutor/TA.

Part 2 of this lab report is a reflection on my learning experience in CSE15L. It lists a few of the interesting things I learnt over the second half of the quarter.
