Lab Report 3
============
Welcome to my second lab report for CSE 15L ! This lab report will explore the interesting command-line options or alternative use-cases for the command `grep`.


A little about `grep`
---------------------

The `grep` command is a powerful and versatile Unix/Linux utility tool used to search for specific patterns of text in files. This can be incredibly helpful when you need to find specific information in a large text file or locate all occurences of a particular string in a directory full of files. Additionally, `grep` supports regular expressions, which allows for complex pattern matching. Indeed, the `grep` command is a highly useful tool hat can save you a lot of time and effort when working with text files on Unix/Linux systems.

The basic syntax is as follows:

`grep [options] pattern [file...]`
